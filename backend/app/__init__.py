"""STOUT API Modules.

STOUT is a system that translates between two representations of molecules:
SMILES strings and IUPAC names. SMILES strings are a simplified way to
represent a molecule's structure, while IUPAC names are a more formal and
systematic way to name a molecule. STOUT uses a technique called neural
machine translation, which is similar to how machines translate languages
like French to English. In this case, the machine translates between the
"language" of SMILES strings and the "language" of IUPAC names. STOUT achieves
high accuracy, correctly translating molecules in most cases.
